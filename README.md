# Overview

I did this project to demonstrate some of the core capabilities of the C++ language. During the course of this project I learned the syntax and process of programming in C++.

For this project, I used an IDE called CodeBlocks, and programmed using the C++ Standard Library (STL).

I decided to write a Tic-Tac-Toe game, which takes turns between two players, and saves the winner to a leaderboard.
